# Changelog

User-facing release notes. Newest first.

## Unreleased (branch `autonomous/product-improvements`)
### Added
- **Paste a list:** in the deck editor, tap **Paste a list** and paste a vocab list, one card per line. PrepPop finds the separator on its own (tab, " - ", ":", "=", or ","), strips numbering like "1.", and shows how many cards it found before you add them. Quizlet exports paste in directly. Tick **Definition comes first** if your list is the other way round.
- Delete decks from the deck list, and delete a card while studying it.
- Answer service (Cloudflare Worker) so visitors don't need their own API key for AI answers. Needs deploying first; see `README.md`.
